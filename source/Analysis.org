** Expectations

**** =You are expected to=:
+ produce a clear statement that describes the problem area and specific problem that is being solved/investigated
+ outline how they researched the problem
+ state for whom the problem is being solved/investigated
+ provide background in sufficient detail for a third party to understand the problem being solved/ investigated
+ produce a numbered list of measurable, "appropriate" specific objectives, covering all required functionality of the solution or areas of investigation (Appropriate means that the specific objectives are single purpose and at a level of detail that is without ambiguity)
+ report any modelling of the problem that will inform the Design stage, for example a graph/network model of Facebook connections or an E-R model.

**** =A fully scoped analysis is one that has=:
+ researched the problem thoroughly
+ has clearly defined the problem being solved/investigated
+ omitted nothing that is relevant to subsequent stages
+ statements of objectives which clearly and unambiguously identify the scope of the project
+ modelled the problem for the Design stage where this is possible and necessary.

* Write Up Your Analysis
:PROPERTIES:

** Structure and content
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: document
:END:

Organise and write your Analysis section using the expectations and marking criteria above. The expectations ask you to include the following five key areas:
1. Problem definition:
   + what is your problem intended to do?,
   + what is the target audience? 
   + what it intends to address?
2. Background: 
   + what makes you choose this problem?
3. Are there any existing similar problem?
   + What are the existing solutions can and cannot do and what your solution intends to address those gaps?
   + What are your target audience survey/interview results?
   + What justifications do you have for your solution
   + Research and Investigation: ?
4. Objectives:
   + a list/set of milestones to achieve a working solution. For example: 1. Create a database to permanently store user details, product details and suppliers' details. 2. Create a user interface so that a manager of the store can log on to manage the stock. 3. Create mechanism so that when a particular product numbers reach a limit, it automatically triggers email to a specified stock 
5. Model (E-R diagram)
   
   + Entity relationship or data flow diagram to show how data will be passed among different components of the intended system.
   + A network graph of the interconnected components if any.
6. Organise your writing based on the expectations. You can download a copy of the Analysis template [[file:doc/AnalysisTemplate.docx][here]].
