|     3 |        7-9 | Fully or nearly fully scoped analysis of a real problem, presented in a way that a third party can understand. Requirements fully documented in a set of measurable and appropriate specific objectives, covering all required functionality of the solution or areas of investigation. Requirements arrived at by considering, through dialogue, the needs of the intended users of the system, or recipients of the outcomes for investigative projects. Problem sufficiently well modelled to be of use in subsequent stages.                                                          |
|     2 |        4-6 | Well scoped analysis (but with some omissions that are not serious enough to undermine later design) of a real problem. Most, but not all, requirements documented in a set of, in the main, measurable and appropriate specific objectives that cover most of the required functionality of a solution or areas of investigation. Requirements arrived at, in the main, by considering, through dialogue, the needs of the intended users of the system, or recipients of the outcomes for investigative projects. Problem sufficiently well modelled to be of use in subsequent stages. |
|     1 |        1-3 | Partly scoped analysis of a problem. Requirements partly documented in a set of specific objectives, not all of which are measurable or appropriate for developing a solution. The required functionality or areas of investigation are only partly addressed. Some attempt to consider, through dialogue, the needs of the intended users of the system, or recipients of the outcomes for investigative projects. Problem partly modelled and of some use in subsequent stages                                                                                                          |
