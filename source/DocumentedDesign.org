|-------+------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|     3 |        7-9 | Fully or nearly fully scoped analysis of a real problem, presented in a way that a third party can understand. Requirements fully documented in a set of measurable and appropriate specific objectives, covering all required functionality of the solution or areas of investigation. Requirements arrived at by considering, through dialogue, the needs of the intended users of the system, or recipients of the outcomes for investigative projects. Problem sufficiently well modelled to be of use in subsequent stages.                                                          |
|     2 |        4-6 | Well scoped analysis (but with some omissions that are not serious enough to undermine later design) of a real problem. Most, but not all, requirements documented in a set of, in the main, measurable and appropriate specific objectives that cover most of the required functionality of a solution or areas of investigation. Requirements arrived at, in the main, by considering, through dialogue, the needs of the intended users of the system, or recipients of the outcomes for investigative projects. Problem sufficiently well modelled to be of use in subsequent stages. |
|     1 |        1-3 | Partly scoped analysis of a problem. Requirements partly documented in a set of specific objectives, not all of which are measurable or appropriate for developing a solution. The required functionality or areas of investigation are only partly addressed. Some attempt to consider, through dialogue, the needs of the intended users of the system, or recipients of the outcomes for investigative projects. Problem partly modelled and of some use in subsequent stages                                                                                                          |

** Expectations
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:

**** You are expected to:
+ articulate your design in a manner appropriate to the task and with sufficient clarity for a third party to understand how the key aspects of the solution/investigation are structured.
+ articulate on what the design will rely, eg use of numerical and scientific package libraries, data visualisation package library, particular relational database and/or web design framework. 
+ The emphasis is on communicating the design; therefore it is acceptable to provide:
  + a description of the design in a combination of diagrams and prose as appropriate
  + a description of algorithms, SQL, data structures, database relations as appropriate
  + using relevant technical description languages, such as pseudo-code
  + Where design of a user interface is relevant, screen shots of actual screens are acceptable

|          4 |      10-12 | Fully or nearly fully articulated design for a real problem, that describes how all or almost all of the key aspects of the solution/investigation are to be structured/are structured. |
|------------+------------+--------------------------------|
|          3 |        7-9 | Adequately articulated design for a real problem that describes how most of the key aspects of the solution/investigation are to be structured/are structured. |
|          2 |        4-6 | Partially articulated design for a real problem that describes how some aspects of the solution/investigation are to be structured/are structured. |
|          1 |        1-3 | Inadequate articulation of the design of the solution so that it is difficult to obtain a picture of how the solution/investigation is to be structured/is structured without resorting to looking directly at the programmed solution. |

[[./img/design.png]]
Try to organise your writing using the expectations above. The expectations ask you to include the following key areas:
1. =Packages and framework=: Describe and explain the purpose of any numerical and scientific package libraries, data visualisation package library, particular relational database and/or web design framework will be used.
2. =Files, Data Structures, Methods of Access=: Design any data structures, files,relational database(fields, tables, data types, validation rules, and table relationships) with their purpose and access methods explained.
3. =User Interface Design=: Design and justify any user interfaces and their elements.
4. =Processes=: Include psuedo-code and or flowchart for all processes that will be part of the solution.
