|     3 |        7-9 | Fully or nearly fully scoped analysis of a real problem, presented in a way that a third party can understand. Requirements fully documented in a set of measurable and appropriate specific objectives, covering all required functionality of the solution or areas of investigation. Requirements arrived at by considering, through dialogue, the needs of the intended users of the system, or recipients of the outcomes for investigative projects. Problem sufficiently well modelled to be of use in subsequent stages.                                                          |
|     2 |        4-6 | Well scoped analysis (but with some omissions that are not serious enough to undermine later design) of a real problem. Most, but not all, requirements documented in a set of, in the main, measurable and appropriate specific objectives that cover most of the required functionality of a solution or areas of investigation. Requirements arrived at, in the main, by considering, through dialogue, the needs of the intended users of the system, or recipients of the outcomes for investigative projects. Problem sufficiently well modelled to be of use in subsequent stages. |
|     1 |        1-3 | Partly scoped analysis of a problem. Requirements partly documented in a set of specific objectives, not all of which are measurable or appropriate for developing a solution. The required functionality or areas of investigation are only partly addressed. Some attempt to consider, through dialogue, the needs of the intended users of the system, or recipients of the outcomes for investigative projects. Problem partly modelled and of some use in subsequent stages                                                                                                          |

** Expectations

:END:


- see marking scheme below.
- always aim at the highest level.
- please pay attention to the independent feedback point and think about how you are going to obtain that, i.e. peer review? target users review?
** When marking your work, I will be checking...
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- have you given consideration as to how well the outcome meets the initial requirement?
- have you reflected on the objectives originally set and considered how their solution measures up to those objectives?
- have you obtained independent feedback and reflected upon this?

* Present Your Evaluation

** Structure
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: document
:END:

+ Organise your write up in three sub-sections:
  1. evaluate aganist the requirements/objectives - how well the outcome meet the requirements. Referring back to the tests you have done that show you have met certain requirements/objectives.
  2. future improvement/different approaches if were to re-visit the same problem with reasons.
  3. detailed and realistic independent review/critique of the outcome. Get some feedback from your intended users. This can be a survey, interview summaries.
