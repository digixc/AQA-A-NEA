|     3 |        7-9 | Fully or nearly fully scoped analysis of a real problem, presented in a way that a third party can understand. Requirements fully documented in a set of measurable and appropriate specific objectives, covering all required functionality of the solution or areas of investigation. Requirements arrived at by considering, through dialogue, the needs of the intended users of the system, or recipients of the outcomes for investigative projects. Problem sufficiently well modelled to be of use in subsequent stages.                                                          |
|     2 |        4-6 | Well scoped analysis (but with some omissions that are not serious enough to undermine later design) of a real problem. Most, but not all, requirements documented in a set of, in the main, measurable and appropriate specific objectives that cover most of the required functionality of a solution or areas of investigation. Requirements arrived at, in the main, by considering, through dialogue, the needs of the intended users of the system, or recipients of the outcomes for investigative projects. Problem sufficiently well modelled to be of use in subsequent stages. |
|     1 |        1-3 | Partly scoped analysis of a problem. Requirements partly documented in a set of specific objectives, not all of which are measurable or appropriate for developing a solution. The required functionality or areas of investigation are only partly addressed. Some attempt to consider, through dialogue, the needs of the intended users of the system, or recipients of the outcomes for investigative projects. Problem partly modelled and of some use in subsequent stages                                                                                                          |

** Expectations

:END:

**** You are expected to:

Provide program listing(s) that demostrate your =technical skill=. The program listing(s) should be appropriately annotated and self-documenting (an approach that uses meaningful identifiers, with well structured code that minimises instances where program comments are necessary).
You should present your work in a way that will enable a third party to discern the quality and purpose of the coding. This could take the form of:
+ an overview guide which amongst other things includes the names of entities such as executables, data filenames/urls, database names, pathnames so that a third party can, if they so desire, run the solution/investigation
+ explanations of particularly difficult-to-understand code sections; a careful division of the presentation of the code listing into appropriately labelled sections to make navigation as easy as possible for a third party reading the code listing.  To achieve this, to an extent, is linked to the skill in applying a structured approach during the course of developing the solution or carrying out the investigation.

** The Marking Scheme

**** Completeness of solution (15 marks)

|------------+------------+--------------------------------|
|          3 |      11-15 | A system that meets almost all of the requirements of a solution/an investigation (ignoring any requirements that go beyond the demandsof A-level). |
|------------+------------+--------------------------------|
|          2 |       6-10 | A system that achieves many of the requirements but not all. The marks at the top end of the band are for systems that include some of the most important requirements. |
|          1 |        1-5 | A system that tackles some aspects of the problem or investigation. |

  

**** Techniques Used (27 marks)

+ Program listing(s) that demostrate your =technical skill=.
+ Use syntax highlight software (free online) that will allow your code to be nicely formatted and colour coded.
+ Make sure your code is easy to read by using appropriate font and font size.
+ Organise your code so that each separate program, data file, database names, path to file etc are titled and a clear description is under each title and before the actual listing.
+ The program listing(s) should be appropriately annotated and self-documenting.
