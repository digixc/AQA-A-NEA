|     3 |        7-9 | Fully or nearly fully scoped analysis of a real problem, presented in a way that a third party can understand. Requirements fully documented in a set of measurable and appropriate specific objectives, covering all required functionality of the solution or areas of investigation. Requirements arrived at by considering, through dialogue, the needs of the intended users of the system, or recipients of the outcomes for investigative projects. Problem sufficiently well modelled to be of use in subsequent stages.                                                          |
|     2 |        4-6 | Well scoped analysis (but with some omissions that are not serious enough to undermine later design) of a real problem. Most, but not all, requirements documented in a set of, in the main, measurable and appropriate specific objectives that cover most of the required functionality of a solution or areas of investigation. Requirements arrived at, in the main, by considering, through dialogue, the needs of the intended users of the system, or recipients of the outcomes for investigative projects. Problem sufficiently well modelled to be of use in subsequent stages. |
|     1 |        1-3 | Partly scoped analysis of a problem. Requirements partly documented in a set of specific objectives, not all of which are measurable or appropriate for developing a solution. The required functionality or areas of investigation are only partly addressed. Some attempt to consider, through dialogue, the needs of the intended users of the system, or recipients of the outcomes for investigative projects. Problem partly modelled and of some use in subsequent stages                                                                                                          |

- The requirement is to provide a representative sample of the testing that has happened across the project and not record and evidence every individual test. 
- Testing may occur during different parts of the project and when this has happened it is important that a student clearly reflects this in their project.  
- As part of the testing section it may be appropriate to contain a table of tests performed at different stages of the project and a link to any evidence of this.
- It would also be appropriate for a student to perform more traditional testing of the solution at the end of coding where the robustness and completeness of the solution are tested.
** When marking your work, I will be checking...
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- Does the section demonstrate that thorough testing has been carried out?
- Have the core requirements been tested?
- Is there evidence that the more technically challenging parts of the project have been tested?

* Present Your Testing Evidence

** Structure

:END:

+ A table of content of your tests organised by areas of testings. For example, UI testing, Data validation testing, Network connection testing, Two player mode testing etc.
+ Make a title/heading for each testing areas. You may have multiple tests under each. 
+ For those individual tests, specify clearly:
  + Test scope, for example, test login
  + Test data if appropriate
  + Expected result
  + The actual outcome of the test with comments
  + Evidence of test in the form of screenshots, annotating your evidence as needed to bring attention to the outcome.
  + Any improvement after the test if not as expected
